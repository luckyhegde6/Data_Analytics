# Understand the fundamentals:
RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System. 
RDBMS is the basis for SQL, and for all modern database systems such as MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access.

The data in RDBMS is stored in database objects called tables. A table is a collection of related data entries and it consists of columns and rows.

 ## Points to be Conssidered
- SQL keywords are NOT case sensitive: `select` is the same as `SELECT`
- Some database systems require a semicolon at the end of each SQL statement.
Semicolon is the standard way to separate each SQL statement in database systems that allow more than one SQL statement to be executed in the same call to the server.

## Some popular Data types: 
 VARCHAR, INT, DATE, FLOAT, BOOLEAN
 
## Constraints: 
PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, CHECK and NOT NULL

## Commands
 - DDL commands : CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE
 - DML commands : INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE
 - TCL commands : COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT
 - DCL commands : GRANT and REVOKE
 - DQL commands : SELECT, FROM and WHERE clause is used for, also DISTINCT and LIMIT (or TOP) with GROUP BY and HAVING clause
